## Geo-blocking

Some apps are specific to region. For example, `air.ITVMobilePlayer` is specifc
to GB. If you try it from US, details will work, but delivery will fail:

~~~
> googleplay -a air.ITVMobilePlayer
Title: ITV Hub: Your TV Player - Watch Live & On Demand
UploadDate: Dec 9, 2021
VersionString: 9.19.0
VersionCode: 901900000
NumDownloads: 17.429 M
Size: 35.625 MB
Offer: 0.00 USD

> googleplay -a air.ITVMobilePlayer -v 901900000
panic: Geo-blocking
~~~

It seems headers are ignored as well:

~~~
Accept-Language: es
Accept-Language: es-AR
Accept-Language: es-ES
~~~

You can change the country [1], and then you get expected result:

~~~
> googleplay -a air.ITVMobilePlayer

VersionString: 9.19.0

## INSTALL\_FAILED\_NO\_MATCHING\_ABIS

This can happen when trying to install ARM app on `x86`. If the APK is
`armeabi-v7a`, then Android 9 (API 28) will work. Also the emulator should be
`x86`. If the APK is `arm64-v8a`, then Android 11 (API 30) will work. Also the
emulator should be `x86_64`.

However note that this will still fail in some cases:

## Version history

If you know the `versionCode`, you can get older APK [1]. Here is one from 2014:

~~~
googleplay -a com.google.android.youtube -v 5110
~~~

but I dont know how to get the old version codes, other than looking at
websites [2] that host the APKs.
